Description:

This is a Relativity Post-Install event handler that reads a configuration file for settings used to generate documents and productions sets imported as test data. The app dynmaically loads the importAPI from the Relativity Library in the environment it is installed.

Use:

#1: Update the config file
Update DataPopulateConfiguration.Json with your Relativity credentials, the number of documents to generate and specify true or false to indicate whether images should be imported with the documents and production. The  location of the Relativity Library folder on the webserver must also be specified because this application dynamically copies the importAPI before it's used to generate the documents.

#2: Upload the config file
Upload DataPopulateConfiguration.Json to the Resource Files tab, attach it to the application named Default

#3: Install the application
Install the application into a workspace. The post install event handler attached to the application will read the config file and generate documents and a production.
